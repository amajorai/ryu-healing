//! Wire contract for the Ryu **self-healing** loop — the shapes that cross the
//! loopback boundary between Core and the out-of-process `ryu-healing` sidecar.
//!
//! When a run fails, Core posts its instruction + failure output to the sidecar's
//! `POST /api/healing/report-failure`. The sidecar owns the whole decision side —
//! the per-source attempt cap, the cooldown, the Gateway diagnosis call, the
//! `healing.*` prefs — and answers with a [`HealVerdict`]. Core owns the *action*
//! side, because every action is a kernel coupling the sidecar cannot reach: the
//! approvals-inbox write and the agent / workflow re-run.
//!
//! So the two halves need the same verdict vocabulary and neither may link the
//! other. This crate is that shared middle: `serde`-only, no `apps/core`
//! dependency, no `axum`/`tokio`. Same topology as
//! [`ryu-teams-contracts`](https://docs.rs/ryu-teams-contracts) between Core and the
//! teams sidecar.
//!
//! Two constants live here for a sharper reason than the enum does. [`HEAL_PREFIX`]
//! and [`MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS`] are agreements the two binaries keep **out of band** —
//! nothing on the wire carries them, so a mismatch is not a deserialization error,
//! it is silently wrong behaviour:
//!
//! - Core mints a re-run id as `{HEAL_PREFIX}{uuid}`; the sidecar's `decide_heal`
//!   drops any failure whose source id starts with `HEAL_PREFIX` (rule #1, *never
//!   heal a heal*). If the two strings ever diverge, the loop guard stops firing and
//!   a failing heal-retry heals itself forever.
//! - Core truncates the failed run's context with [`truncate_context`] before
//!   posting it, applying a policy the sidecar's prompt budget assumes.
//! - The `kind` field of the report body is a bare string on both sides, and the
//!   sidecar's parse is `"workflow"`-or-else-agent — so a misspelling does not 400,
//!   it silently heals a failed workflow as if it were an agent.
//!   [`SOURCE_KIND_AGENT`] / [`SOURCE_KIND_WORKFLOW`] are that agreement.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT here: `HealSource`, `HealDecision`, `HealConfig`,
//! `HealAttempt` and the `HealingHost` trait. `HealSource` does not cross the wire as
//! a *type* — each side keeps its own enum, flattened to / parsed from the `kind`
//! string above — and the rest are the sidecar engine's own internals. The rule this
//! crate follows: share what nothing else can check. A mismatched enum shape is a
//! compile error at the flatten; a mismatched string literal is a silent behaviour
//! change, so the literal is shared and the enum is not.
